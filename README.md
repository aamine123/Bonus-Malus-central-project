# Bonus-Malus-central-project
The project is dedicated to the CGA (General Committee of Insurance).

The application is based on the establishment of a decision-making system dedicated to the analysis and monitoring of insurance market transactions for Bonus-Malus system insurance contracts and sinister.

We created a dashboard integrated into a website that we developed using Django. we created a platform of prediction that help user to predict the number of accidents, the class bonus-malus of the insured and predict if an accident was a fraud or not.
